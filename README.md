### Some notes about the source code

This solution replies on [Paket](http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) for
dependency management. So, you may need to issue the following command before
running any of the tests.

```
> .paket\paket.exe install
```

_Additionally, this code has only been tested on Windows 8.1 (64-bit). However,
other platforms should work with little or no modification._
